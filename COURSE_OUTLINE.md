# Topics in computational chemistry: CH40208

This is an eleven week module designed to introduce programming in Python (as a tool for use in computational chemistry) and demonstrate aspects of computational chemistry in practice (such as analysing chemical simulations and performing chemical calculations).

## Week 1: Introduction to Python

W/C: 2019-09-30

Material:

- Basic introduction to the Python programming language
- Pythonic base variable types
- Basic arithmatic
- Input (using `input()`) and output (using `print()`)
- Logical operators (`==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`)
- Flow control (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- And and or operators

Problem:

- Create some code to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Code to calculate equilibrium constants for a variety of different units

## Week 2: Lists, loops, arrays, optimisation, and plotting

W/C: 2019-10-07

Material:

- Loops (both `for` and `while`)
- Lists as a data type
- NumPy arrays
- How NumPy arrays may be used to improve code efficiency
- Copying of lists and arrays
- Plotting
- Reading from a file

Problem:

This week there are two problems:

- Code to calculate interatomic distances
- Optimise the interatomic distance code from the week previous

## Week 3: Functions and modular code

W/C: 2019-10-14

Material:

- Functions
- Modules; where functions are collected for reuse
- Energy minimisation; local vs global minimisation

Problem:

Write a function to calculate the energy between a pair of atoms, then implement a simple Newton-Raphson minimisation algorithm.

## Week 4: Debugging

W/C: 2019-10-21

Material:

- Efficiently understanding error messages
- Explanation of StackOverflow
- Introducing problem generalisation
- Rotation matrices

Problem:

Code a rotation matrix from the work of Evans

## Week 5: Good coding practice and testing

W/C: 2019-10-28

Material:

- Comments and docstrings
- Readable code
- Basic testing (`assert` functions)
- Test driven development

Problem:

Given a set of tests, write code that will pass

## Week 6: Exercise week 1
