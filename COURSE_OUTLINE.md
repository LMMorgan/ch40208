# Topics in computational chemistry: CH40208

This is an eleven week module designed to introduce programming in Python (as a tool for use in computational chemistry) and demonstrate aspects of computational chemistry in practice (such as analysing chemical simulations and performing chemical calculations).

## Week 1: Introduction to Python

W/C: 2019-09-30

Material:

- Basic introduction to the Python programming language
- Pythonic base variable types
- Basic arithmatic
- Input (using `input()`) and output (using `print()`)

Problem:

Create some code to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius

## Week 2: Pythonic logic and loops

W/C: 2019-10-07

Material:

- Logical operators (`==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`)
- Flow control (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- And and or operators
- Loops (both `for` and `while`)

Problem:

This week there are two problems:

- Code to calculate interatomic distances
- Code to calculate equilibrium constants for a variety of different units

## Week 3: Lists, arrays, and optimisation with NumPy

W/C: 2019-10-14

Material:

- Lists as a data type
- NumPy arrays
- How NumPy arrays may be used to improve code efficiency
- Copying of lists and arrays

Problem:

Optimise the interatomic distance code from the week previous

## Week 4: Functions and modular code

W/C: 2019-10-21

Material:

- Functions
- Modules; where functions are collected for reuse

Problem:

Write a function to calculate the energy between a pair of atoms, then implement a simple Newton-Raphson minimisation algorithm.

## Week 5: Debugging

W/C: 2019-10-28

Material:

- Efficiently understanding error messages
- Explanation of StackOverflow
- Introducing problem generalisation

Problem:

Code a rotation matrix from the work of Evans

## Week 6: Good coding practice and testing

W/C: 2019-11-04

Material:

- Comments and docstrings
- Readable code
- Basic testing (`assert` functions)
- Test driven development

Problem:

Given a complete set of tests, write code that will allow all the tests to pass
