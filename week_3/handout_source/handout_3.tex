\section*{Aim}
This lecture will introduce lists, arrays, and show how the NumPy library can be used to make your code faster.

\section{Lists}
The Python programming language natively includes the ability to group together a series of objects.
These are \texttt{lists} and are one of the most powerful Python objects.
A list is defined as follows,
\begin{lstlisting}
# Making a list

elements = ["Hydrogen", "Helium", "Lithium", "Beryllium", "Boron", "Carbon", "Nitrogen", "Oxygen"]
\end{lstlisting}
Having defined the list, it is then possible to select individual items of the list by using the following syntax,
\begin{lstlisting}
# Printing some items

print(elements[0], elements[4], elements[-1])
\end{lstlisting}
Note, that Python starts counting from the number $0$, and using the minus sign we can ask Python to count from the end.
This means that the above code should print, \texttt{"Hydrogen", "Boron", "Oxygen"}.
This counting from $0$ means that in the above list, the string \texttt{"Hydrogen"} would be referred to as the zeroth object in the list, while \texttt{"Helium"} would be the first.

In addition to making use of single objects from within a list, it is also possible to create sublists, for example,
\begin{lstlisting}
# Just the first 4 elements

print(elements[0:4])
\end{lstlisting}
Note that above, the numbers on either side of the colon the list indices.
However, rather strangely, the sublist created is \textbf{inclusive} of the first number and \textbf{exclusive} of the second.
Additionally, it is possible to select non-consecutive objects from a list by placing commas between the indices,
\begin{lstlisting}
# Just the gases

print(elements[0, 1, 6, 7])
\end{lstlisting}
