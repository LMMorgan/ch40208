# Style Guide

- All coding will take place in a Jupyter Notebook, in an effort to offer a real coding experience this will be unstructured with the Notebook starting blank.
- All handout, worksheet material will be in LaTeX. 
- All lecture material will be in Keynote with PDF versions included.
- The following paradigm should be present throughout: 
```
spec -> algorithm -> code
```
- Any changes should be through the usual fork, edit, pull request workflow.

# Content

Each *week* of content should consist of (at a minimum) a lecture handout and a deck of slides. 
Additional content would include a plan for the live-coding content and some solutions to the problem that the students have been set. 

Typically the lecture will involve introducing a particular concept and then providing at the end a problem that uses that concept in a chemistry application. 
Through the lecture, smaller exercises allow the students to have some hands on programming experience for each concept.
