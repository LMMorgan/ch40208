# Style Guide

- All coding will take place in a Jupyter Notebook, in an effort to offer a real coding experience this will be unstructured with the Notebook starting blank.
- All handout, worksheet material will be in LaTeX. 
- All lecture material will be in Keynote with PDF versions included.
- The following paradigm should be present throughout: 
```
spec -> algorithm -> code
```
- Any changes should be through the usual fork, edit, pull request workflow.
