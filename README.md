## Kanban Operations

Just a note on the operating process for the Kanban project tracking. 
There are five stages that describe the process of getting a particular issue done.

- Todo: These are items that need to be done for a given project. 
- In progress: Once you start working on a particular issue (e.g. once you create the branch on your fork), move the issue to "In progress". This means that other know **you** are working on it, and therefore they don't need to. Additionally at this time the particular issue should be assigned to you (so we can track who is working on what). 
- Review: Once you are happy with the work on the given issue, move to "Review" and make a pull request on the master. Someone else can then review the material and provide comments on how the material may be improved. At this stage, the assignment should be changed to the reviewer.
- Resolve: Once the reviewer has made their comments and suggestions, the material should be passed back to the original author to enact, at this stage the issue should be moved to "Resolve", and again the assignment of the issue flipped back to the original author. If the original author would like the material re-viewed at this stage it may be moved back to the "Review" board. 
- Done: Finally once all of the changes are enacted or discussed the issue is moved to "Done" and the pull request approved.
